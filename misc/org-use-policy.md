# GitHub Organizational Use Policy

## Introduction

This document outlines the policy for using the GitHub platform within [Organization Name]. It is designed to ensure that our use of GitHub for software development and collaboration is effective, secure, and compliant with our internal policies.

## Repository Management

### Creating Repositories
- Repositories should be created under the organization account, not personal accounts.
- Choose clear, descriptive names for repositories.
- Private repositories should be used for sensitive projects.

### Repository Settings

- Enable required reviews for pull requests.

## Collaboration

### Issues and Pull Requests

- Ensure that pull requests are reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.

### Code Reviews
- Follow the organization's coding standards during reviews.
- Provide constructive, respectful feedback.
- Request changes when necessary and approve only after all concerns are addressed.

## Security Practices

### Access Management
- Grant access to repositories based on the principle of least privilege.
- Review and update team access permissions regularly.

### Secrets Management
- Use encrypted secrets for storing sensitive information like access tokens and passwords.
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in source code.

## Compliance

### Licensing and Attribution
- Respect the licenses of third-party software and dependencies.
- Ensure that proper attribution is given where required.

### Documentation
